        In dexbot.controller.worker_controller add new strategy inside strategies() as show below:

            name: The name that is shown in the GUI for user
            form_module: If there is custom form module created with QTDesigner

        Adding strategy to CLI
        In dexbot.cli_conf add strategy in to the STRATEGIES list
